Check Your Understanding:
1) No, I wouldn't use this for a "message" feature because it is pretty broad and has many features so we are not testing a specific one. Many features include what is in the message and if the message sent. It isn't small enough to do a unit test on and there are components interacting for this message, which isn't possible to be tested in this unit test. There isn't really something to measure and again, there are many factors to measure because of many features.

2) Yes, I would use "max message length" for a unit test. This is because we are testing a single, measurable feature. We simply need to make a test that would see if it allows for messages more than 80 characters. If it is, then it fails. It needs to pass all tests by making sure each case is less than 80 characters. It also isn't a feature that depends on other features and can be singled out.
